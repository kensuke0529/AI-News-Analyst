5. **Choose your AI News Analyst repository**
6. **Railway will automatically detect the configuration**

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Go to your project dashboard**
2. **Click on "Variables" tab**
3. **Add the following environment variables**:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `your_openai_api_key_here` | **Required** - Your OpenAI API key |
| `DAILY_TOKEN_LIMIT` | `5000` | Daily token limit (optional) |

3. **Your app will be available at the Railway-provided URL**

## üîß Troubleshooting Railway Deployment

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **"Error creating build plan with Railpack"**

**Problem**: Railway can't detect the build configuration.

**Solution**: 
- Make sure `railway.json` is in the root directory
- Verify the Dockerfile path in `railway.json` is correct
- Check that all required files are committed to GitHub

#### 2. **Build Fails During Docker Build**

**Problem**: Docker build process fails.

**Solution**:
- Check that `config/requirements.txt` exists
- Verify all file paths in Dockerfile are correct
- Ensure all source files are present

#### 3. **Application Won't Start**

**Problem**: App builds but doesn't start properly.

**Solution**:
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid
- Check Railway logs for error messages

#### 4. **Port Issues**

**Problem**: Railway can't connect to the application.

**Solution**:
- Railway automatically detects ports from Dockerfile
- Make sure `EXPOSE 8002 3000` is in Dockerfile
- Check that the start command is correct
